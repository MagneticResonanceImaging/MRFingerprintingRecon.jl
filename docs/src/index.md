# MRISubspaceRecon.jl

[MRISubspaceRecon.jl](https://github.com/MagneticResonanceImaging/MRISubspaceRecon.jl) package package aims to enable rapid iterative reconstruction
of Cartesian and non-Cartesian MRI data using subspace modeling [1,2]. Particular care is given to enable the reconstruction of large numbers of subspace coefficients along with large image grid sizes.

For compatibility with other Julia packages, such as [IterativeSolvers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/IterativeSolvers.jl) and [RegularizedLeastSquares.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImageRecon/RegularizedLeastSquares.jl), operations are defined in terms of linear operators and their effects on the data vectors. [MRISubspaceRecon.jl](https://github.com/MagneticResonanceImaging/MRISubspaceRecon.jl) is designed to compute these objects with multi-threaded CPUs and on NVIDIA GPUs. The package further contains functions to perform GRAPPA operator gridding (GROG) [3] or to generate radial trajectories. However, all methods that require an explicit k-space trajectory as input generalize to arbitrary trajectories.

The documentation of all exported functions can be found in the [API](@ref) Section.

# Background

A general (non-Cartesian) subspace reconstruction of coefficient
images $\hat{\bm{x}_c}$ from k-space data $\bm{y}$ can be formulated as:
```math
\hat{\bm{x}}_c = \underset{\bm{x}_c}{\text{arg min}} \lVert \mathbf{GFSU}_R\,\bm{x}_c-\bm{y} \rVert_2^2 
\equiv \underset{\bm{x}_c}{\text{arg min}} \lVert \mathbf{A}\bm{x}_c-\bm{y} \rVert_2^2
```
where $\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ are block-diagonal Fourier and gridding matrices. $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ represent the forward operator (or system matrix) and coil sensitivity profiles, respectively. $\mathbf{U}_R$ is a block matrix composed of $R$ temporal
basis functions; its adjoint $\mathbf{U}_R^H$ projects the time series of images onto the basis: $\bm{x}_c = \mathbf{U}_R^H\bm{x}_t$, where $\bm{x}_t$ denotes the complete time series of images. 
    
To decrease computation time, iterative reconstructions employ Toeplitz embedding to avoid repeated gridding operations of non-Cartesian data [4,5,6]. This means that the normal operator $\mathbf{A}^H\mathbf{A}$ 
is implemented as a pointwise multiplication at the cost of an oversampling factor of 2 across each spatial dimension. The resulting operator is an $R\times R$ matrix per k-space sample and thus has a large total size of $8N_xN_yN_zR^2$ for a 3D image. We exploit several methods throughout to handle the large memory requirement, especially when using a GPU for reconstruction. A main point for users is that a real-valued basis $\mathbf{U}_R$ reduces the memory requirement for storing the normal operator by a factor of 2.

# CPU or GPU
Reconstructions of non-Cartesian MRI in [MRISubspaceRecon.jl](https://github.com/MagneticResonanceImaging/MRISubspaceRecon.jl) are implemented for CPU and NVIDIA GPUs. The GPU code is included as a Julia extension and is loaded after importing CUDA.jl via:
```
using MRISubspaceRecon
using CUDA
```
We recommend using the GPU code which can be faster by a factor of 10--20 than CPU multi-threading (for typical solvers like conjugate gradient or FISTA [7]). However, a specific GPU implementation for Cartesian MRI is still under development. In this case, one can use the CPU implementation or the non-Cartesian methods.
